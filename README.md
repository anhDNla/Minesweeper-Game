**Minesweeper Game â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

Developed a fully functional web-based version of the classic Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing complex game logic to ensure accurate mine placement, grid generation, and user interactions.

Key Features:
  - **Dynamic Grid Generation:** Created a flexible grid system that adjusts based on selected difficulty levels.
  -**Mine Placement Algorithm:** Engineered a randomized yet balanced distribution of mines to maintain a fair and challenging gameplay experience.
  - **User Interaction & Feedback:** Implemented intuitive UI elements, including clickable cells, flagging mechanics, and real-time visual feedback using dynamic CSS animations.
  - **Difficulty Levels:** Designed multiple game modes with varying grid sizes and mine counts to cater to both beginners and advanced players.
  - **Scoring & Timer System:** Integrated a countdown timer and a performance-based scoring mechanism to enhance competitiveness.
  - **Game State Management:** Ensured smooth gameplay flow with win/loss detection, restart functionality, and proper event handling.
    
This project significantly improved my front-end development skills, deepened my understanding of JavaScript event-driven programming, and strengthened my ability to design engaging and responsive user interfaces.
