# 💣 Minesweeper Game – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

A fully functional web-based version of the classic **Minesweeper** game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on game logic, dynamic grid generation, difficulty scaling, user interaction, and responsive UI behavior.


## 📌 Project Overview

The Minesweeper game was designed to deepen understanding of **JavaScript event-driven programming**, **frontend development**, and **interactive UI design**.  
Players can choose difficulty levels, interact with a dynamic grid, and receive real-time game feedback.

### Key Features
- Dynamic grid generation with randomized mine placement  
- Multiple difficulty levels  
- Flagging, cell revealing, and win/loss detection  
- Countdown timer and scoring system  
- Interactive design with responsive UI feedback  
- Smooth gameplay flow with event-driven logic


## 🧩 Gameplay Mechanics

### Grid & Mine Generation
- Flexible grid created based on selected difficulty  
- Random yet balanced mine distribution  
- Automatic recalculation of surrounding mine counts  

### Player Interaction
- Clickable cells with reveal animations  
- Right-click flagging system  
- Real-time feedback using CSS transitions  
- Safe reveal logic and recursive empty cell expansion  

### Difficulty Modes
- Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced game modes  
- Varying grid sizes & mine counts  
- Designed for both casual players and challenge seekers  

### Scoring & Timer System
- Countdown-based game timer  
- Score bonuses for speed and accuracy  
- Game over animation for win/loss states  

### Game State Management
- Win/loss detection  
- Restart functionality  
- Proper event cleanup  
- Stable, predictable gameplay flow
